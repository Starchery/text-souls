# Text Souls

A cute Dark Souls-esque text-based game written in Rust.

I needed practice in Rust so I made this. I wrote this a few years ago for my AP Computer Science Principles project, 
so it's likely riddled with beginner level bugs and terrible programming practices.

This project was apparently only good enough to warrant a grade of 4/5, so take from that what you will.

Good luck beating the Taurus Demon.

### Options
  ```-f, --fast```: Sonic mode

  ```-h, --help```: Print a helpful message

### Screenshots
Soon to come.

### Installation
You'll need to have Rust and Cargo installed.

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/starchery/text-souls.git
$ cd text-souls
$ cargo build
```

From there you can run the game with ```$ cargo run ``` or ```$ ./target/debug/text-souls ```

### To-Do
* **Add more areas**
* Rework hit and crit chance system
* **Add a GUI (ncurses, termbox)**
* Add name system, deprecate descriptions
* Add inventory system
